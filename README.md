## Hi there! 
I'm Sia, and I study Cognitive Science with a specialization in machine learning and Computer Science at UC San Diego and I am a Software Engineer at UniWise.

I joined UniWise as an intern and eventually became a founding engineer. I worked on the core backend, helped with some frontend features, and spent a lot of time doing UX research and user interviews. I picked up some JavaScript and TypeScript along the way since our tech stack used them. 

At UniWise, I helped build our main AI system that analyzes scanned multimodal medical records and produces an audit with accurately highlighted contraindication annotations within the document. I also contributed to another product that uses real time call transcripts to automatically fill out forms and answer medical questions with an agentic workflow.

I’m interested in how Software engineering, AI, psychology, and cognitive science can be combined to design products that actually help and feel natural to use. I was also a teaching assistant at UCSD for Cognitive Consequences of Technological Design and Intro to Large Language Models. 

Most of what’s on my GitHub is school work or projects I built on my own time while exploring ideas and learning new tools.
